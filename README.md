This project is based on `pyTelegramBotAPI` APIs, that allows implementation of useful telegram instruments in telegram directly using python. The purpose of the project was to build a bot able to answer FAQ from university community, to give the semester draft, to provide information about the regional service for scholarship or other type of information by a link to the website. 
It can be considered as an aggregator. 

While writing this code, I was attending an italian university, so most of names used for variables and for courses names are in this languange: I apologize for it and i hope it can be useful anyway.

Just run main.py to build the server (a telegram bot ID is needed in order to make it work and to have a the chatbot on telegram).

Thank you for reading <3
